New strcture of code
[make a titled section for each of these]

(0)
Comment block, with author, date, etc.

(1) 
Processing constants and other constants (basically all the const types)

(1.5)
Output files (basically all the TFiles and ofstreams)
	- Create a TFile to store the output

(2)
Functions for fitting and solutions (basically all the TF1)
	- Define a TF1 for neutron PSD (single gaussian)
	- Define a TF1 for photon PSD (single gaussian)
	- Define a TF1 for combined (in terms of the other 2)
	- Define a TF1 for the difference between neutrons and photons

(2)
define histograms (basically all the TH1, TH2 etc)

(3)
Fill the histograms (this loops through all the events and fills histograms)

(4)
Analysis of the histogram
	- Clone the histograms and get guesses for the fit parameters (mean, amplitude, standardDeviations)

(5)
Fitting og the histograms 
	- define the pointer for the fit
	- use the parameters from (4) to inform the fit
	- extract the parameters from the combined fit and set the parameters for the individual fits
	- 

(6)
Discrimination line
	- Apply the function defined in (1) to find the discrimination line
	- Also find the discrimination line by finding where the difference between the neutron and the photon fit go to zero

(7)
Draw
	- Create a canvas
	- cd into the canvas
	- draw the combined histograms
	- draw all 4 fits: neutron, photon, sum, difference
	- Define and draw three discrimination lines: middle, 2 stdDev from neutron, and 2 stdDev from photon
	- Define a legend for the lines

(8)
Save
	- Write the canvas
	- Write the file
	- Close the file
